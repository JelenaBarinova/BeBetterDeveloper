Hello dear reader, my name is **Sergejus** and I am DEVELOPER. It's no brainier  good developers are good at learning. I decided to put my learning, challenges and thoughts into this blog that will help me (and hopefully others) to [be a better developer](http://www.bebetterdeveloper.com).

Despite my background in .net, cloud and recent interest in node.js, I believe there is more than java developer, ruby developer or .net developer. Developer is the mindset that's why this blog will be language agnostic.

As I've mentioned, this blog is about my path on becoming a better developer and I decided to start with the most "uncomfortable" for me topic - algorithms. Next post will be the first in series so stay tuned!

P.S.
Your ideas, comments, suggestions are very welcomed.
